/**
 * Framework-internal slot names stashed on DOM `Element` instances by
 * the compiler. Centralized so that the property name lives in ONE
 * place and the interface field is type-tied to the constant via a
 * computed property name — a rename touches every reader/writer at
 * once, with TypeScript flagging any drift as a compile error.
 *
 * **The drift risk that motivates this module.** Each slot is referenced
 * across multiple files: a `defineProperty` write site, an interface
 * field declaring the type, and one or more read sites. Before this
 * module the literal `'$$ngControllers'` appeared in three files; a
 * rename in one would silently break the other two with no compile
 * failure and no test failure (unless a specific regression test
 * happened to exercise the broken path). The `as const` constants
 * below + the `NgManagedElement` interface using `[NG_*]?:` computed
 * property names tie all sites together at the type level.
 *
 * **Why all four slots in one interface.** Every slot is optional
 * (created lazily via `Object.defineProperty` and cleared on teardown),
 * so it costs nothing to declare them together. Readers cast to
 * `NgManagedElement` and pick whichever fields they need — the same
 * pattern used by the original file-local interfaces in
 * `cleanup.ts` / `compile.ts` / `require-resolver.ts` / `ng-transclude.ts`.
 *
 * Slot semantics live in the files that own each lifecycle:
 *   - `$$ngScope` / `$$ngCleanupQueue` — `cleanup.ts` (spec 017 Slice 10).
 *   - `$$ngControllers` — `compile.ts:stashController` write, `require-
 *     resolver.ts:readController` read (spec 022 Slice 3 / Slice 4).
 *   - `$$ngBoundTransclude` — `compile.ts` install, `ng-transclude.ts`
 *     parent-element walk (spec 018).

 * `parentScope` the linker held BEFORE the isolate scope existed — i.e.
 * the scope a true outer DOM sibling shares.
 *
 * Non-isolate directives that publish into the scope (currently only
 * `ngRef`) read this slot so their published reference lands on the
 * surrounding scope rather than on the isolate scope the element's own
 * link fn receives — AngularJS parity for `linkFn.isolateScope ?
 * isolateScope : scope`. On a non-isolate element the slot is absent

 *
 * Implementation uses the `in` operator — no `as` cast in the body —
 * so the guard is a real runtime check, not a type-system fiction. A

 * been set on an element the corresponding key sticks around (cleanup
 * sets the value to `undefined` but does not `delete` the descriptor),
