/**
 * `ngSwitch` + `ngSwitchWhen` + `ngSwitchDefault` — value-driven subtree
 * selection (spec 027 Slice 5 / FS §2.2, technical-considerations §2.3).
 *
 * `<div ng-switch="expr"><div ng-switch-when="A">…</div><div ng-switch-default>…</div></div>`
 * renders AT MOST ONE matching child block based on the stringified
 * value of the parent's `ng-switch` expression. Every transition tears
 * down the previously-rendered child (including its scope and DOM) and
 * mounts a fresh deep clone of the newly-matching child (with a fresh
 * transclusion scope). Multiple `ng-switch-when` blocks sharing the same
 * value render TOGETHER when that value matches — AngularJS-canonical
 * behavior, uncommon but supported.
 *
 * **Architecture: parent-controller + child-registration.** Mirrors the
 * AngularJS-canonical implementation exactly:
 *
 *  1. `ngSwitchDirective` (the parent) declares a `controller`
 *     (`NgSwitchController`) and `require: 'ngSwitch'` (self-require).
 *     The controller exposes mutable state — a `cases` map keyed by
 *     stringified expression value, and three parallel arrays tracking
 *     currently-mounted transcludes / scopes / DOM clones.
 *  2. Each `ngSwitchWhenDirective` / `ngSwitchDefaultDirective` (the
 *     children) declares `transclude: 'element'` (so its content is
 *     captured into a master fragment at compile time and replaced
 *     in-place by a Comment placeholder per spec 027 Slice 2) AND
 *     `require: '^ngSwitch'` (so it can find the parent controller via
 *     the spec-022 Slice-4 ancestor walk through `parentElement`).
 *  3. At link time, each child registers its `{ placeholder, transclude }`
 *     pair into the parent's `cases` map under its `attrs.ngSwitchWhen`
 *     key (or `'?'` for default).
 *  4. The parent's link fn installs a `scope.$watch(attrs.ngSwitch, …)`
 *     listener that orchestrates ALL transitions — tearing down the
 *     active set, looking up the new set, and mounting fresh clones.
 *     Children install no clones themselves.
 *
 * **Why children register with the parent (vs. each child watching
 * independently).** A single orchestrator is mandatory for the
 * "exactly-one block at a time" guarantee — if each child watched the
 * expression and toggled its own clone, two `ng-switch-when="A"` blocks
 * could observe the expression flipping to `"A"` in different orders
 * relative to a sibling's teardown, and a transient "no block mounted"
 * frame could appear between Drop + Add. Centralizing the transition in
 * the parent eliminates that race entirely.
 *
 * **Insertion anchor: each child's own placeholder.** When a child
 * registers its transclude with the parent, it ALSO captures the
 * Comment placeholder Slice 2 installed in place of its host element.
 * The parent's clone-attach callback then uses that placeholder as the
 * insertion anchor — `placeholder.parentNode.insertBefore(clone, placeholder.nextSibling)`.
 * The placeholder itself never moves; it permanently occupies the slot
 * the child's original host element used to occupy. As a result the
 * rendered subtree's position relative to its sibling children is
 * preserved across transitions, AND multiple `ng-switch-when` siblings
 * sharing the same value mount in document order (each next to its own
 * placeholder).
 *
 * **The `'?'` key for default.** AngularJS canonically stores the
 * default-block transcludes under the literal string `'?'` (a value no
 * valid `ng-switch-when` attribute can produce because `?` is not a
 * legal scope-expression-value stringification). The parent's listener
 * looks up `cases.get(String(value))` first; on a miss it falls back to
 * `cases.get('?')`; on a miss there too, the slot stays empty.
 *
 * **String-equality semantics.** `String(value)` is used for the match
 * key — `null` / `undefined` / `0` / `false` all stringify deterministically
 * (`'null'`, `'undefined'`, `'0'`, `'false'`). Numeric switch-when
 * values written as attribute strings (`ng-switch-when="0"`) therefore
 * match the stringified scope value, NOT loose-equality coercion. This
 * mirrors AngularJS 1.x and is the FS §2.2 acceptance criterion.
 *
 * **Cleanup contract on transitions.** The parent's `$watch` listener
 * tears the previously-active set down via the canonical order:
 *   1. `scope.$destroy()` on each transclusion scope (fires
 *      `$on('$destroy', …)` listeners, tears the scope sub-tree down).
 *   2. `clone.remove()` to detach from the live DOM.
 *   3. Zero out the parallel `selectedTranscludes` / `selectedScopes` /
 *      `selectedClones` arrays.
 * The order matches spec 027 Slice 3's `ng-if` teardown (`cloneScope.$destroy()`
 * BEFORE `clone.remove()` so any `$destroy` listeners that read DOM
 * state can still do so).
 *
 * **Inert outside an enclosing `ng-switch`.** A `<div ng-switch-when="A">`
 * with no parent `ng-switch` triggers `MissingRequiredControllerError`
 * via the spec-022 Slice-4 `require: '^ngSwitch'` resolver, routed by
 * the per-element controller seam through `$exceptionHandler('$compile')`.
 * No new error class is needed; the FS §2.2 acceptance criterion
 * "helpers without parent throw" is satisfied by the existing
 * spec-022 mechanism.
 *
 * **Errors.** No new error classes. No new `EXCEPTION_HANDLER_CAUSES`
 * token. The tuple stays at 10. Every error site reuses existing
 * surfaces: `MissingRequiredControllerError` (children without parent),
 * `'watchListener'` (a throwing `$watch` listener inside the parent),
 * `'$compile'` (throws inside `$transclude` invocations).
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <div ng-switch="user.role">
 *   <div ng-switch-when="admin">Admin panel</div>
 *   <div ng-switch-when="member">Member dashboard</div>
 *   <div ng-switch-default>Public view</div>
 * </div>
 * <!-- After compile:
 *      <div ng-switch="user.role">
 *        <!-- ngSwitchWhen: admin -->
 *        <!-- ngSwitchWhen: member -->
 *        <!-- ngSwitchDefault:  -->
 *      </div>
 *      With user.role = 'admin' the parent's $watch fires and mounts a
 *      fresh deep clone of the admin <div> after its placeholder.
 *      Flipping user.role to 'member' destroys the admin clone's scope,
 *      removes the admin clone from the DOM, and mounts a fresh member
 *      clone after the member placeholder. -->
 * ```
 *
 * @example Multiple when-blocks sharing a value
 * ```html
 * <div ng-switch="kind">
 *   <div ng-switch-when="alert">Top banner</div>
 *   <p>(static markup in between)</p>
 *   <div ng-switch-when="alert">Bottom banner</div>
 * </div>
 * <!-- With kind = 'alert' BOTH alert blocks render simultaneously,
 *      each next to its own placeholder. AngularJS-canonical multi-
 *      match behavior. -->
 * ```
